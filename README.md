## FAQs

<!--Qustion 1 -->
<details cloed>
<summary>What is Spontaneous?</summary>
<br>
Spontaneous is an iOS application built for iOS15 - iOS16. The idea
of the application is to help people who can't decide or want to do 
something on the spot. This application helps with this problem by allowing 
the application to do the picking on what to do. The application will 
also give directions to the location it selects. The user can filter on/off
specific locations.

<summary>How Does Spontaneous Differ From Google or Apple Maps?</summary>
<br>
Google and Apple provide a map of the world, you can enter an address, restaurant etc and
can get directions. Spontaneous Differ From Google or Apple because Spontaneous uses your local
area to find something.

<summary>Why Not Have Spontaneous On iPad?</summary>
<br>
I have thought about including iPad in the list of devices but 
through a lot of considerations, I felt it would be better on iPhone 
as it's easier to carry around. In the future I could include iPads.
