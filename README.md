# Spontaneous

## Overview

Status: Under Active Development / Work-In-Progress

Spontaneous is a dynamic application currently in development, stemming from a six-month university project. The goal is to transform it into a fully functional application ready for deployment on the App Store. The purpose of Spontaneous is designed to help users discover spontaneous activities in their local proximity, such as cafes, restaurants, or cinemas. The application will provide directions to the selected destination.

## FAQs

<!--Qustion 1 -->
<details cloed>
<summary>What is Spontaneous?</summary>
<br>
Spontaneous is an iOS application built for iOS15 - iOS17. The idea
of the application is to help people who can't decide or want to do
something on the spot. This application helps with this problem by allowing
the application to do the picking on what to do. The application will
also give directions to the location it selects. The user can filter on/off
specific locations.

<summary>How Does Spontaneous Differ From Google or Apple Maps?</summary>
<br>
Google and Apple provide a map of the world, you can enter an address, restaurant etc and
can get directions. Spontaneous Differ From Google or Apple because Spontaneous uses your local
area to find something.

<summary>Why Not Have Spontaneous On iPad?</summary>
<br>
I have thought about including iPad in the list of devices but
through a lot of considerations, I felt it would be better on iPhone
as it's easier to carry around for this kind of application. In the future I could include iPads.
